# hello-world
This repository was created to my own learning about github.
Hello guys, my name is Bruno and I'm from Brazil. Since I had statistic subject in my college, I became more interested in issues like how to code and how code can improve my life as a researcher. I'm thankfully about coursera, since this platform is becoming true my desires about this subject.
